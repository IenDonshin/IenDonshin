# Hello! Welcome to my Github homepage ðŸ‘‹

## ABOUT ME ðŸ”­
I am YAN Dongxin, pronounced as 'ien donshin' in Japanese. <br>
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in linguistics, I worked for some years. Curious about language, culture, and society in the digital age, I returned to school and am currently studying computational social science as a master course student.
