# ABOUT ME 🤔
I am YAN Dongxin, pronounced as 'ien donshin' in Japanese. 
I come from a county on the North China Plain, where there are endless fields, white wind turbines, and towering residential complexes.
# ABOUT MAJOR 🔭
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in linguistics, I worked for some years. 
A curiosity for language, culture, and society in the digital age led me to pursue a master's degree in computational social science.
