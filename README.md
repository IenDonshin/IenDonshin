# ABOUT ME ðŸ”­
I am YAN Dongxin, pronounced as 'ien donshin' in Japanese. 
I come from a county on the North China Plain, where there are endless fields, white wind turbines, and towering residential complexes.
# ABOUT MAJOR ðŸŒ±
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in linguistics, I worked for some years. 
Curious about language, culture, and society in the digital age, I returned to school and am currently studying computational social science as a master course student.
